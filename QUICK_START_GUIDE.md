## 🗣️ Conversation Mode

**The killer feature!** Perfect for real-time conversations between people speaking different languages.

### How It Works

Imagine you're in a meeting with:
- **Person A** speaks English
- **Person B** speaks French

Traditional mode: You'd have to manually switch languages. 😫

**Conversation Mode**: Automatically detects and translates both ways! 🎉

### Setup (3 Steps)

1. **Enable Conversation Mode**:
   ```
   ✅ Check "🗣️ Conversation Mode (Bidirectional Auto-Translate)"
   ```

2. **Set Your Language Pair**:
   ```
   From: English
   To: French
   ```

3. **Start Listening**:
   ```
   Click "🎤 Start Continuous Listening"
   ```

### What Happens

- **English detected** → Translates to French 🇫🇷
- **French detected** → Translates to English 🇬🇧
- **Auto-switching** based on what's spoken
- **No manual intervention** needed!

### Auto Mode (Advanced)

Enable "Auto (Any Language Pair)" to work with ANY language combination:

```
✅ Conversation Mode
✅ Auto (Any Language Pair)
```

Now the app will:
- Detect ANY language spoken
- Pair it with other detected languages
- Auto-route translations intelligently
- Perfect for multilingual environments!

### Example Scenario

**International Business Meeting**:
```
Setup:
- English ↔ Japanese conversation mode
- Whisper engine (offline, private)

Result:
- English speakers understood in Japanese ✅
- Japanese speakers understood in English ✅
